        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <p>Fallow Media is an alternative space for contemporary creativity. We publish work from across the artistic specturm that challenges our inherited ideas of form, structure and content. We believe that the internet offers us critical and conceptual approaches that remain largely unexploited in the worlds of literature, music and the arts. Fallow Media operates at a slower pace in the hope of questioning our own assumptions about what publishing online can look and feel like.</p>
        <p>Everything published on Fallow Media begins with a blank page: there are no templates and no shortcuts. We are not interested in getting everything right first time around. This is a learning process, and an attempt to share in a new way. We hope that this approach will not only change the way people see our work, but also the way we work in the first place.</p>
